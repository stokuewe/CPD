# Contracts â€“ Milestone M1

No external service or network API contracts required for M1.

Scope limited to GUI behaviors and local/remote database connectivity workflows. Future milestones may introduce:
- Internal service abstraction contracts (storage adapter interface)
- IFC import/export service boundaries
- Logging and context capsule serialization contracts

This placeholder asserts that no REST/GraphQL schemas are produced for M1.
